Designed for carrying goods, supplies, and passengers, these canoes were essential for trade networks and the movement of people in regions rich in waterways. While not built for speed or combat, their ample capacity and versatility made them indispensable for transporting heavy cargo or large groups, ensuring the economic and logistical backbone of many societies."

Small and nimble, this type of canoe was popular for trade, riverine warfare, and coastal raids, particularly among warriors and raiders. While a single war canoe posed little threat to fortified positions, their speed and agility made them potentially dangerous when deployed in large numbers, especially in ambushes or coordinated assaults."
